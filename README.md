`license` is a command line tool to create LICENSE files.

It provides good defaults for name and year on license (customizable if needed), and
it supports all license types listed on the [GitHub Licenses API](https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/) and a few more. The license templates used by this program were copied from the GitHub Licenses API, when available.

## Usage

#### Print license

To print a license to stdout, run the `license` command followed by the license name:

```
$ license mit
```

#### Save to file

Use the `-o` flag to save the license to a file, or use your shell's redirection operator:

```
$ license -o LICENSE.txt mit
$ license mit > LICENSE.txt
```

#### Customize name and year

```
$ license -year 2013 -name "Alice L" isc
```

The current year is used if `-year` is omitted.

To determine the name on the license, the following are used in this order:

```
- command line flags: -name, -n
- environment variable: LICENSE_FULL_NAME
- gitconfig and hgconfig
- "os/user".Current()
- empty string
```

If you have your name set in `$HOME/.gitconfig`, you can almost always omit the `-name` flag.
